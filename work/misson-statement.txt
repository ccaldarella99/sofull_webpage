Motto: Fuel for the body, Peace for the mind

I am a very lucky man. One of the reasons I consider myself to be so
fortunate, is that I learned at a very early age what I was supposed to
do with my life. The genesis of Sofull Snacks came while biking across
the beautiful country of Myanmar. Towards the end of a long day of
riding, our guide stopped at a vendor in a small roadside market. “Every
time I am here, I have to get these” said the guide, handing me a bag of
what appeared to be large round “crackers.”
Having cooked professionally for the better part of my life, I was
fascinated by these snacks and judging by my surroundings, I assumed
that they were locally made, and with little to no processing. After
asking around, I learned that were made with mashed soybeans, chilies,
and rice. They would then take this mixture and press out little discs on
palm woven mats, and let them dry out in the sun for a few days.
Healthy, delicious, and local, I couldn’t stop thinking about them.

After returning home, I started to think about the three main
ingredients: beans, rice, and spices. I started to realize that these three
things are the backbone to almost all ethnic foods. It’s their Soul Food.
From then on, I started experimenting with different beans and grains
from all over the world, figuring out how to turn them into snacks
similar to what I had experienced in Myanmar. I found my true calling.
When people find out you cook for a living, the always ask the same
question. “What is your favorite thing to cook?” After years of not
knowing what to say, I can finally answer that question….Sofull food.
