The Denver. We are proud to share with you a cracker that truly represents
our Mile High City. What better way to do our city justice than to create
something all natural and full of flavor? And that is exactly what we did.
Pinto Beans, and hatch green chilies star in this cracker, with sorghum
addinig an extra nutrional boost. Low in fat, and high in flavor, with only 70
calories per 1 ounce serving, itâ€™s ok to indulge and still feel great.
