And that is exactly what we did. Pinto Beans, and hatch green chilies star in this cracker, with sorghum adding an extra nutrional boost.

								During a bike trip in the beautiful country of Myanmar, we stopped at a tiny village Market and were introduced to crackers made from local ingredients and spices. They were absolutely delicious, organic and pure. I set out to create my own version of these crackers and embody the notion that soul food really exists all over the world and revolves around these three simple ingredients: beans, rice and spices. The results are in this bag of SoFull Crackers. So full of passion, so full of creativity, so full of love and so full of favor.

							<p class="text">
								I am a very lucky man. One of the reasons I consider myself to be so fortunate, is that I learned at a very early age what I was supposed to do with my life. The genesis of Sofull Snacks came while biking across the beautiful country of Myanmar. Towards the end of a long day of riding, our guide stopped at a vendor in a small roadside market. “Every time I am here, I have to get these” said the guide, handing me a bag of what appeared to be large round “crackers.” 
							</p>
							<p class="text">
								Having cooked professionally for the better part of my life, I was fascinated by these snacks and judging by my surroundings, I assumed that they were locally made, and with little to no processing. After asking around, I learned that were made with mashed soybeans, chilies, and rice. They would then take this mixture and press out little discs on palm woven mats, and let them dry out in the sun for a few days. Healthy, delicious, and local, I couldn’t stop thinking about them.
							</p>
							<p class="text">
								After returning home, I started to think about the three main ingredients: beans, rice, and spices. I started to realize that these three things are the backbone to almost all ethnic foods. It’s their Soul Food. From then on, I started experimenting with different beans and grains from all over the world, figuring out how to turn them into snacks similar to what I had experienced in Myanmar. I found my true calling. When people find out you cook for a living, the always ask the same question. “What is your favorite thing to cook?” After years of not knowing what to say, I can finally answer that question... Sofull food.
